### About the book

Set in Notting Dale, West London; remnant of "primitive" New Guinea tribe
living in large Victorian house, and maintaining or adapting their tribal
customs amid London life, a process studied and shared by their protector, a
female anthropologist. One of their number is killed, and Pibble —
intelligent, unassertive, tends to get assigned to off-beat cases that will
bring no one any kudos — investigates.

### Author Comment

*"The Glass-sided Ants' Nest" was the working title right up to late proof
stage, when an elderly partner at my UK publishers wandered into the editorial
offices, picked up a cover proof and said "You know, no woman will buy a book
with an insect in the title." Ah well. I reverted as soon as I got the
chance.*

### Reviews

{{< quote cite="Independent (12 February 2012)" >}}
The Glass-Sided Ant's Nest (1968) deservedly won the Crime Writers'
Association's Gold Dagger, and a more peculiar crime novel would be hard to
find. In it, a tribe of erudite New Guinea natives are discovered grieving for
their fallen chief in a London house. He has been battered to death with an
owl (taken from a banister) and is found with a double-sided penny in one
hand. The unravelling of the plot reveals a gender-switched marriage, a bowl
of blood, and a weird smell of burning rubber, all of which provide clues.

Every conceivable boon of knowledgeablity, excitement, local colour and
intelligent good humour.

Here is something different, colourful, unexpected.

{{< quote cite="Louis Untermeyer" >}}
A most original plot, with a solution to match. I can't recall a situation so
strange or an unfolding so suspenseful.

{{< quote cite="Ross Macdonald" >}}
Highly original...Mr. Dickinson's anthropological invention and sociological
wit...give his novel real distinction.
