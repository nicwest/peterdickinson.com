About the Book
--------------
Nonsense fantasy about a mischievous modern witch. Illustrated by Sue Porter. Included a single (lyrics by Pete Townshend, music by Billy Nicholls) on a plastic disc, with a lyrics sheet. Originally sold shrinkwrapped.

### Author Comment
_This story began as a means of coaxing small children through their meals. I wouldn't go on till they'd eaten another spoonful. It gave me plenty of time to think about the next surreal twist. I found that great fun, but not at all easy to reproduce the same kind of spontaneous zest in print._
