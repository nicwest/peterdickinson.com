About the Book
--------------
Novelty picture book, with a hole right through the middle, performing a different function on every page.

### Author Comment
_Well that was the theory, but I now think I wasn't ingenious enough to make it work properly. I'd been digging by our front gate when our neighbours' small daughter came past, fingering excitedly at a brown paper-package — from the bran-tub at a Village Hall fete, I guessed. I asked her what she'd got. "I don't know yet," she said. "But it isn't a book — it's got a hole in it." She sounded pleased about it. It felt like another good place to start, but this time it wasn't._
