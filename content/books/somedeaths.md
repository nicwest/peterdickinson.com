### About the book
Rachel is bed-ridden, paralysed, barely able to speak. Only her mind and will remain. Watching _The Antiques Roadshow_ she sees a young woman bring a duelling pistol to be valued, and recognises it for one of a unique pair that she had once given her husband. She asks the nurse to open a secret compartment in her bureau. The pistol box is still where she put it, but one pistol is missing. How? Why?

Viewpoints shift: Rachel's nurse, who does the legwork on her days off; the young working wife who brought the pistol to the show; and Rachel herself, mining back through her immense collection of photographs to stimulate her memory and recover the true past that led to this present.
