About the Book
--------------
England changes, machines become wicked and people dangerous. Heartsease is the second of Peter Dickinson’s “Changes” trilogy. (_The Devil’s Children_ tells how this strange era began, and _The Weathermonger_ how it ended.) Three children in a Cotswold village rescue a “witch”, nurse him and smuggle him to safety, with the help of a heroic pony and the ancient tug that gives the book its title.

This is a story of desperate adventuring in a world where every adult may be an enemy. Each detail is sharp and solid, so that the wildest imaginings read like sober truth; and the characters —from horse-loving Margaret through whose eyes the whole story is seen, to hall-mad Davey Gordon the witch-hunter seem as real as our everyday neighbours.
