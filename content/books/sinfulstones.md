### About the book

James Pibble has been summoned to a remote Scottish island by his long-dead father's ex-employer, the semi-senile Nobel Prize-winner, Sir Francis Francis. Before long, he finds himself attempting to extract Sir Francis from the grip of a crazed millenarian sect which seems determined to keep him there. It seems they will stop at nothing to make sure he stays. Including murder...

### Reviews

{{< quote cite="Daily Telegraph" >}}Fantastically inventiveâ€¦a story full of imaginative detail with a stirring, sardonic end.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="Sun" >}}Here is that rare bird among thrillers: one that combines sheer speed and subtlety, through sheer writing skill.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="Times Literary Supplement" >}}A delight to read. {{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="The Times" >}}Splendid.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="Scotsman" >}}So richly contoured as to demand comparison with the best contemporary fiction.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="Louis Untermeyer" >}}Peter Dickinson is a master of the bizarre...The Sinful Stones is bewildering and yet believable, marvelously mad but perfectly logical...I had an unusually good, and often gripping, time with it.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="New Republic" >}}This Scottish yarn is like a lightweight, well woven, expertly tailored Harris tweed. To scramble metaphors, the cunning mechanism of the plot purrs like a Rolls, and the writing is luscious thick Devon cream. There's been nothing like it in British mystery fiction since Michael Innes and Edmund Crispin.{{< /quote>}}
