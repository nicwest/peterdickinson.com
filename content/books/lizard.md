### About the book

Thanassi Thanatos (the tycoon first met in _Sleep and his Brother_) invites Pibble to Greek Island hideout to play role of Mafia in war-game style simulation of business opponents' likely actions. Pibble suggests elimination of Thanatos himself and then investigates the possibility for real. That’s why Jimmy Pibble joins five other men and a beautiful girl around a conference table in a lavish Mediterranean villa.

But what have two drunken Greek monks to do with murder. And how does a penniless English artist fit into the scene? Jimmy Pibble will find out – but not before someone has died…
