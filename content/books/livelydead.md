About the Book
--------------

Omni-competent Lydia Timms owns a large house in a once-grand Notting Hill terrace, living in the basement with her family and renting out the rest of the building. She has to cope with a husband recovering from a breakdown, a lively autistic son, dry-rot under the floor-boards, the problems of her tenants, including the government-in-exile of the Baltic state of Livonia on the top two floors, and the recent death of her garrulous and strong-willed cleaner. In the opening sequence she attends the funeral, but then the cleaner's body is discovered buried in her back garden.

{{< quote cite="Times (London)" >}}How delicious it is...events, spies, frighteners, and zaniness begin from page one and mount in liveliness and suspense to the end. Characters are splendid, sky-high improbable, but always rooted in simple truth. Description of both scenes and happening is wonderfully skillful.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="Kirkus Reviews" >}}Peter Dickinson upstages almost everyone around with his distinctively different, stylish and literate entertainments and just one word will do - exceptional.{{< /quote>}}
