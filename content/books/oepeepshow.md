### Reviews

{{< quote cite="Sunday Telegraph" >}}A literary magician.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="San Francisco Chronicle" >}}This is a bit crazy, harrowingly suspenseful, surprising - and different…not to be missed, if the offbeat appeals to you.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="Punch" >}}Irresistible {{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="Edmund Crispin, Sunday Times" >}}A Pride of Heroes confirms Peter Dickinson as the best thing that has happened to serious, sophisticated, witty crime fiction since Michael Innes{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="London Evening Standard" >}}Mr Dickinson follows his first prize winning whodunnit with a cracker-jack detective story...cool disciplined, witty.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="Oxford Mail" >}}It is going to be hard to beat for its remarkable combination of elegance, whackiness and excitement...one almost unbroken climax...quite unputdownable.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="Guardian" >}}Mr Dickinson is the most original crime novelist to appear for a long, long time.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="New York Times Book Review" >}}Read this book carefully. It's a jewel.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="Chicago Tribune" >}}For the choicest of mystery confections try 'The Old English Peep Show' - there are mock duels, mock hangings, and two kinds of terribly intent killers at work.{{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="Lewiston (Me.) Journal" >}}The author of 'The Glass-Sided Ants' Nest' has fashioned another fine mystery yarn in 'The Old English Peep-Show.' In this story Superintendent Pibble of Scotland Yard has been given, as usual, a case no-one else desired to handle...Before the story ends, he finds himself in great danger, with the story winding up in a smashing climax. {{< /quote>}}

{{< quote cite="Washington (D.C.) Star" >}}The author of 'The Glass-Sided Ants' Nest' has produced another distinctive book featuring Scotland Yard's Superintendent Pibble in an investigation at a stately home that is now a show place with a lion park, where distinguished brothers, the general and the admiral, reside. The admiral's ex-coxswain has killed himself and therein lies the beginning of an unsettling tale.{{< /quote>}}
