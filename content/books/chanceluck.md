About the Book
--------------

Collection of original material, prose and verse, fact and fiction, on the themes of the title.

### Author Comment
_My UK editor, Joanna Goldsworthy, asked if I'd like to do a short non-fiction book about chance and luck. I'm very interested in the subject, but not enough of a coherent thinker to do a straight treatise. A sort of scrap-book was an obvious solution, and since I'm also hopeless at research it was much easier for me to use fiction and verse to illustrate some of the points. I threw in Destiny, which is the opposite of chance, to make a more resonant title; and magic, because that's an attempt to defy the randomness of chance and luck; and to give the whole thing some kind of structure I threaded a re-telling of the Oedipus legend through it. It's still a bit scrappy, and parts of it work better than others, but there's a fair amount there that I'm still pleased with._
