About the Book
--------------
Fire is powerful, unpredictable and contradictory: a lightning strike may burn down a village or rejuvenate an old forest. The pyre of the Phoenix also gives it birth; a fireworm may destroy a tribe, or a regiment of dragons save a country.

This collection tells five tales of creatures who live and die by fire, tales of the present day and the prehistoric past - a tale of a confrontation in a haunted graveyard, of the Firespace where only dragons can survive, of a boy who is claimed by Fire, of a young man who chases the fireworm through dark tunnels of dream, and of the long history of the Phoenix.
