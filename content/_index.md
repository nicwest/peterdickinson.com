## FEATURED BOOK

**The Yellow Room Conspiracy**

Two ex-lovers, he merely getting old, she already slowly dying, hear a radio
quiz programme about a political/financial/sexual scandal in which they were
both involved at the time of the Suez Crisis. At the end of the first chapter
she asks him to tell her how he killed one of the other participants. He
replies that he'd always imagined she had done it. Who then did?

Her illness means that she is no longer up to prolonged serious discussion, so
he starts to write out his memories of the time for her to read, and she
responds with taped recordings of how she saw the same events. In this manner
they re-tread the maze of high politics, espionage and shady property deals
and find the answer.
