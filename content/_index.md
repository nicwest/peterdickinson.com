## FEATURED BOOK

**The Lizard in the Cup**

Thanassi Thanatos (the tycoon first met in Sleep and his Brother) invites Ex-Chief Inspector Pibble to his Greek Island hideout to play role of Mafia in war-game style simulation of business opponents’ likely actions. Pibble suggests elimination of Thanatos himself and then investigates the possibility for real. That’s why Jimmy Pibble joins five other men and a beautiful girl around a conference table in a lavish Mediterranean villa.

But what have two drunken Greek monks to do with murder? And how does a penniless English artist fit into the scene? Jimmy Pibble will find out – but not before someone has died…

Forty years later Andrew, now the famous Adrian Waring, tells the story to his partner and explains his own part in the tragedy that followed.
