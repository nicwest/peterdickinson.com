Short Stories
================

Peter has written several short stories over the years, some published in anthologies, some in other places.  We’ve started to collect these stories and will publish some of them here.

#### [The Legends of St Thick](/stthick)
These short snippets about a very stupid but revered holy man were first published in _Hundreds and Hundreds_ (Puffin 1984), an anthology Peter edited in celebration of the NSPCC’s 100th anniversary. They still make him laugh…

#### [Barker](/barker)
This story was first published in Guardian Angels (Viking 1987).  Fifteen previous winners of the Guardian Children’s Fiction Award were asked to write a story on the theme of a guardian angel. Peter’s funny and charming story about a very unusual guardian was the result.

#### [In the Mermaid Tavern: The Sea Witch](/mermaidtavern)
Originally written as part of a preface for a new edition of _Water: Tales of the Elemental Spirits_ which Peter wrote with Robin McKinley, this beguiling story was eventually not needed in the printed book.
