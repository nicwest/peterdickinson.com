Peter left a note with his will to ask that any donations in his memory be
made to one of his three nominated charities: [Save the
Children](http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/); [Alzheimer’s
Society](https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/) and/or [Médecins Sans
Frontières](http://www.msf.org.uk/).

We have set up a [Just Giving Memory Page for
Peter](https://www.justgiving.com/remember/244297/Peter-Dickinson), linking a
donation page for each of these three charities.

If you would like to make a donation to one or more of these charities in
Peter’s memory, just click on the logo below.  That will take you through to
the donation page for that charity.

Many thanks from Peter’s family.
