      <description>Memories of Peter (1) Peter’s brother, Hugh, shared the following memories of Peter’s childhood at the memorial on 6 Jan 2016:
My earliest memories of Peter are when he was four years old, in our tropical bungalow in Livingstone (now Zambia)—within sight of the plume of spray from the Victoria Falls. We each had an African minder and a pet: Richard a sulky eagle owl chained to a stump; Pete a mongoose which nipped our heels but was meant to deter snakes (Dickie, our Dad, named it Ricki-Ticki-Tavi after Kipling); I had an armadillo which was singularly unresponsive to affectionate stroking.</description>

      <description>Memories of Peter (2) Peter’s eldest daughter, Philippa, shared the following memories of Peter’s early career at the memorial on 6 Jan 2016:
So there was Peter at King’s College, Cambridge. Dad, typically, said that he felt he wasted his time there, worked ineffectually and took little part in the many extra-curricular activities on offer. He didn’t get the hoped-for first in his finals, but even so, the college gave him a bursary to study for a PhD.</description>

      <description>Memories of Peter (3) Peter’s eldest son, John, shared the following memories of Peter’s blossoming career as a writer at the memorial on 6 Jan 2016:
Now, for this next piece I need you to imagine that I’m voicing over the sound of a typewriter. It’s coming from up a stairway or behind a study door, and it sounds like this:
Chack-chack-chack-chak. (Pause for thought.) Chackchackchackchackchackchack… Peter typing

      <description>My Peter Peter’s wife, Robin McKinley, gave this moving tribute at his memorial in January 2016. This text was first published on Robin’s blog.
Peter’s first romantic fiancé’s gift to me was a pair of secateurs. This was about four hours after he’d said ‘just because you’re taking me on doesn’t mean you have to take gardening on.’ I was in England seeing what I was getting myself into. Peter and I had had an unexpectedly life-altering weekend in Maine about a fortnight before; we knew each other slightly through the book world, I’d visited him at home once when Mary Rose was still alive, he was merely returning the favour.</description>
