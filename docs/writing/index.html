<h1 id="about-writing">About Writing</h1>

<p>Peter says he didn’t become a writer. He just is one, and always has been,
ever since he can remember, the way a goldfish is a goldfish and can’t be
anything else. Go to a zoo and look at one of the big birds, a condor, say, a
creature made to soar above the Andes. They’ve probably clipped one of its
wings so that it can’t hurt itself trying to fly around its cage, but it’s
still a creature made to soar above the Andes. If you somehow stopped Peter
writing, he’d still be a writer.</p>

<p>But he was a poet and a journalist before he started on books. He tried a
murder story first, but got stuck half way through. Then he had a
science-fictiony kind of nightmare, and decided to turn it into a children’s
story, mainly to see if writing it would unstick the other book. (It did. That
book won a prize for the best murder story of the year, and the children’s
book was made into a TV serial.)</p>

<p>Since then he’s written over fifty books, most of them on a little old
portable typewriter — one draft, to see what he’s got, and what else he needs
to know and so on; then a bit of research; then a complete rewrite, beginning
to end; and then, if all’s well, only a bit more tinkering. Sometimes it used
to take a few months, sometimes a year or more. A few years back he moved over
to a PC. It makes writing seem a very different kind of process — easier in
some ways, harder in others.</p>

<p>The ideas come from all over the place — day-dreams, sometimes, or a kid on a
long car-trip saying “Tell us a new story, dad.” Or something he’s heard or
read — a voice on the radio saying “Even a hardened government soldier may
hesitate a fatal half-second before he guns down a child.” For the best of
them it feels as if the book had knocked on the door of his mind and said
“Write me.” Then he’ll spend half a year or more letting the stranger in and
finding who or what it is.</p>

<p>He has written all sorts of books, crime mainly for adults, though some of
these are almost straight literary novels; but for children fantasies,
historical, modern adventure, science fiction and so on.  There won’t be many
more.  They used to come gushing out of the hillside like a mountain stream.
Then he had to lift them up bucket by bucket from deeper and deeper wells,
But now the wells are empty.  He says.</p>
