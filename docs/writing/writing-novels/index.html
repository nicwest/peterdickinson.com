<h1 id="on-writing-novels">On Writing Novels</h1>

<p>I have always taken writing for children and writing for adults equally
seriously, but my relationship with the adult novels is different, more
willed, less “given”. There are of course repetitive themes. My children say
that my definitive novel will be about a chimpanzee trying to support a great
country house by writing best-sellers.</p>

<p>I was brought up as one of the impoverished gentry, but despite a patrician
accent and manner have never felt confident that I belonged in my supposed
class; and I spent formative parts of my adolescence in a big Georgian house
where my two old cousins were struggling on inadequate funds to keep things
going in order to be able to hand it on to the heir to whom it was entailed.</p>

<p>Even as a post-graduate, working abortively for a Ph.D., I soon realised that
I have no talent for research. In my first two books, despite their winning
prizes, the police work is complete nonsense. You’d never get away with it
now. After that I started to set my stories in contexts where police-work
doesn’t operate. I used to say that I write the book first and do the research
afterwards, when I know what I want to know. I prefer to imagine a place
rather than visit it, notebook in hand. I had never been to Greece when I
wrote The Lizard in the Cup, but a travel supplement suggested it for
background reading. (Admittedly my sister-in-law, who lived partly on
Skiathos, read it in manuscript for me.) When this works it works fine. The
imaginative process transfers itself to the reader. When it doesn’t, it’s a
disaster, even in minor details. (As when an actor shuts a door too hard, the
flats quiver, and the solid walls dissolve into paint and canvas.)</p>

<p>The pattern of most of the later books, with past events being re-interpreted
one way or another from the present, has been more or less forced on me. Both
from circumstances and from temperament I have tended to live less and less in
the world around me. I am nearly eighty. For me, the young are another
country, the past somehow less so, even when I step outside my natural milieu.
In order to write about these books I’ve had to re-read them. I can’t have
looked at A Summer in the Twenties almost since it was published. It is set
even longer ago, the year before I was born, but the scenes among the strikers
in Hull strike me as tolerably convincing. Perhaps this is merely that
distance blurs the tell-tale details, but certainly I wouldn’t dare set such a
scene in the present.</p>

<p>The later books also moved nearer to the mainstream novel, though not often
reviewed as such. The walls of literary ghettos are remarkably impermeable.
But when The Last House-Party was specially well reviewed in the US a
journalist called me from New York to ask me what I was going to do now people
were taking me seriously as a writer. I couldn’t think of an answer. Almost
all my books have the solution of a murder puzzle as a resolving element in
the plot, but in the earlier ones the rest of the book is only the context
that allows the puzzle to be set and resolved, whereas in the later ones the
puzzle is a mechanism that allows the book as a whole to come into existence.</p>

<p>Of course I’ve used bits and bobs of my own experience here and there, though
I’ve seldom based my characters on people I’ve known. Hindsight and Perfect
Gallows are more autobiographical. My prep school was evacuated to a house
very much like that in the book, and its staff were as described (I regret
this. Though they must have all been dead, people who remembered them minded,
I’m told.) Paul Rogers is based on myself, both as a child and adult. The
events and characters involved in the whodunit element of the story are of
course inventions. I thought of book at the time as an amusing box of tricks,
but re-reading I was surprised to find an unpleasant gynaecophobic streak in
it. Surprised because on the whole I think I’ve got a good record here, in
both genres, to the extent that a well-regarded novelist, reviewing The Lively
Deadon the radio, said she assumed that Peter Dickinson was a pseudonym for a
woman.</p>

<p>Though the house in Perfect Gallows was designed by Lutyens, it and its
setting, including the dovecote, are otherwise very like the Georgian house
where I spent some of my adolescence. In appearance too, but not in character,
its inhabitants, apart from the black butler, are modelled on those I knew. My
cousin Lucy believed that she might have had a career in the London theatre,
and I took part in several of the performances she staged. There was an
American camp in the park, preparing for D-day, with officers billeted in the
house. Andrew/Adrian, I hasten to say, is nothing like me. I’ve never believed
that any artist, however great, is entitled to sacrifice other people to his
art, even when they themselves think the sacrifice worth while.</p>

<p>From the very first I have written my books, in both genres, starting on page
one with no more than an idea – an interesting milieu or set-up, a feeling
that “there’s a book there.” The Glass-sided Ants’-nest began with a waking
vision of an elderly man, dressed in pyjamas and with tribal scars on his
cheeks, lying on bare boards in what I knew to be a London house, with an oil
lamp burning at his feet and his tribe, in European clothes, kneeling around
him.</p>

<p>My last-but-one started when I was in Maine, helping my fiancée pack up her
house so that she could come and live with me in England. There came a morning
when there was nothing much for me to do except wait around to let someone
into the house, so I fed a sheet of paper into a borrowed typewriter and
started. Shortly before I’d left England Id been working in a sunlit
flower-border, listening a a “humorous quiz about the Profumo scandal, and
wondering how it must feel to any still-living participants to hear their old
shames and agonies so pawed over so I began there. When Robin returned from
whatever she’d been doing I showed her the resulting chapter, ending as
described above. “Wow!” she said, or words to that effect. “What’s going to
happen?” I told her I had no idea.</p>

<p>I call Some Deaths before Dying my last adult novel advisedly. It was
published without trouble in America, well reviewed, and sold enough to keep
everyone happy. In the UK it was rejected by all the mainstream publishers,
usually with comments to the effect that it was beautifully written but too
old-fashioned. A small edition was eventually published by a library supplier,
and barely reviewed at all. I doubt I’ve enough time left to me to spend any
of it trying again.</p>
