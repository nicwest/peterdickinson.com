<h3 id="about-the-book">About the book</h3>

<p>James Pibble has been summoned to a remote Scottish island by his long-dead father&rsquo;s ex-employer, the semi-senile Nobel Prize-winner, Sir Francis Francis. Before long, he finds himself attempting to extract Sir Francis from the grip of a crazed millenarian sect which seems determined to keep him there. It seems they will stop at nothing to make sure he stays. Including murder&hellip;</p>

<p>
<q>Fantastically inventiveâ€¦a story full of imaginative detail with a stirring, sardonic end.</q>

<cite>Daily Telegraph</cite>

</p>


<p>
<q>Here is that rare bird among thrillers: one that combines sheer speed and subtlety, through sheer writing skill.</q>

<cite>Sun</cite>

<p>
<q>A delight to read. </q>

<cite>Times Literary Supplement</cite>

<p>
<q>Splendid.</q>

<cite>The Times</cite>

</p>


<p>
<q>So richly contoured as to demand comparison with the best contemporary fiction.</q>

<cite>Scotsman</cite>

</p>


<p>
<q>Peter Dickinson is a master of the bizarre...The Sinful Stones is bewildering and yet believable, marvelously mad but perfectly logical...I had an unusually good, and often gripping, time with it.</q>

<cite>Louis Untermeyer</cite>

</p>


<p>
<q>This Scottish yarn is like a lightweight, well woven, expertly tailored Harris tweed. To scramble metaphors, the cunning mechanism of the plot purrs like a Rolls, and the writing is luscious thick Devon cream. There's been nothing like it in British mystery fiction since Michael Innes and Edmund Crispin.</q>
