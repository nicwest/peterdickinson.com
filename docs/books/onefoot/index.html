  <h1>One Foot in the Grave</h1>
  
  <h3 class="subtitle">The last of six novels with Detective James Pibble</h3>
  
  

<h3 id="about-the-book">About the book</h3>

<p>A coda to the Pibble series. Pibble is in a nursing home, prematurely feeble and despairing. To put an end to it by dying of hypothermia, he slips out one bitter winter&rsquo;s night and climbs to the top of the water tower, only to find that the place he had chosen is already occupied by the dead body of another. Duty drives him to return and report it, and then, inexorably, he finds himself forced to unravel, from his sick-bed and through the come-and-go of delirium, what happened, and why.</p>
