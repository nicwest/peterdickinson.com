<h3 id="about-the-book">About the book</h3>

<p>If Prince Edward hadn&rsquo;t died in 1892 he would have succeeded to the throne of England, instead of his brother George, and reigned as King Victor I, to be succeeded in his turn by his grandson King Victor II, the present monarch. Much would have remained the same, but much would have been very, very different. E.g., as a young man the king had refused to go into the army and insisted on having a medical training. In the same spirit his daughter, the teen-age Princess Louise, from whose point of view the story is seen, attends Holland Park Comprehensive. The palace is troubled by a series of practical jokes, humorous at first, but becoming increasingly unpleasant, until a corpse is discovered on the throne of England.</p>

<h3 id="reviews">Reviews</h3>

<p>
<q>The works of British Mystery writer Peter Dickinson are like caviar—an acquired taste that can easily lead to addiction. Dickinson.. . does not make much of the process of detection, nor does he specialize in suspense. Instead, he neatly packs his books with such old-fashioned virtues as mood, character and research.</q>

<cite>Time Magazine</cite>

</p>


<p>
<q>Peter Dickinson has a fantastic eye for creating imaginary settings that come across as real and believable. They add to his mysteries a special extra fillip of enjoyment. He out-does himself this time.. . . A most unusual and original mystery. </q>
