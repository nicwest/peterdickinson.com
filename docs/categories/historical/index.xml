      <description>About the Book Historical. Byzantine slave boy journeys into Hun territory to rescue captured daughter of the house, taking the trained household bear with him to act as a kind of passport (everyone would welcome the entertainment provided by a dancing bear) as he moves from the dangerous complexities of the city into the equally dangerous simplicities of the nomad Huns.
Author Comment This was the first of my books to evolve from a story I&amp;rsquo;d told my sons to stop them squabbling in the back seat during our weekly commute to and from Hampshire.</description>
