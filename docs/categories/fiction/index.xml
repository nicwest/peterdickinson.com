      <description>About the book A coda to the Pibble series. Pibble is in a nursing home, prematurely feeble and despairing. To put an end to it by dying of hypothermia, he slips out one bitter winter&amp;rsquo;s night and climbs to the top of the water tower, only to find that the place he had chosen is already occupied by the dead body of another. Duty drives him to return and report it, and then, inexorably, he finds himself forced to unravel, from his sick-bed and through the come-and-go of delirium, what happened, and why.</description>

      <description>About the book Set in Notting Dale, West London; remnant of &amp;ldquo;primitive&amp;rdquo; New Guinea tribe living in large Victorian house, and maintaining or adapting their tribal customs amid London life, a process studied and shared by their protector, a female anthropologist. One of their number is killed, and Pibble — intelligent, unassertive, tends to get assigned to off-beat cases that will bring no one any kudos — investigates.
Author Comment &amp;ldquo;The Glass-sided Ants&amp;rsquo; Nest&amp;rdquo; was the working title right up to late proof stage, when an elderly partner at my UK publishers wandered into the editorial offices, picked up a cover proof and said &amp;ldquo;You know, no woman will buy a book with an insect in the title.</description>
