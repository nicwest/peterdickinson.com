      <description>About the Book Collection of original material, prose and verse, fact and fiction, on the themes of the title.
Author Comment My UK editor, Joanna Goldsworthy, asked if I&amp;rsquo;d like to do a short non-fiction book about chance and luck. I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in the subject, but not enough of a coherent thinker to do a straight treatise. A sort of scrap-book was an obvious solution, and since I&amp;rsquo;m also hopeless at research it was much easier for me to use fiction and verse to illustrate some of the points.</description>
