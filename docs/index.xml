      <description>About the book Set in Notting Dale, West London; remnant of &amp;ldquo;primitive&amp;rdquo; New Guinea tribe living in large Victorian house, and maintaining or adapting their tribal customs amid London life, a process studied and shared by their protector, a female anthropologist. One of their number is killed, and Pibble — intelligent, unassertive, tends to get assigned to off-beat cases that will bring no one any kudos — investigates.
Author Comment &amp;ldquo;The Glass-sided Ants&amp;rsquo; Nest&amp;rdquo; was the working title right up to late proof stage, when an elderly partner at my UK publishers wandered into the editorial offices, picked up a cover proof and said &amp;ldquo;You know, no woman will buy a book with an insect in the title.</description>

      <description>About the Book England changes, machines become wicked and people dangerous. Heartsease is the second of Peter Dickinson’s “Changes” trilogy. (The Devil’s Children tells how this strange era began, and The Weathermonger how it ended.) Three children in a Cotswold village rescue a “witch”, nurse him and smuggle him to safety, with the help of a heroic pony and the ancient tug that gives the book its title.
This is a story of desperate adventuring in a world where every adult may be an enemy.</description>

      <description>Books that Mattered to me When Young St George for England by G.A. Henty
I came across a copy of this not long ago and was astonished to find how bad it is, mostly undigested chunks of history about the Hundred Years’ War, with our hero popping up from time to time to have an adventure. Early on he rescues the girl who becomes his childhood sweetheart. You don’t hear about her again till near the end, when you find he’s married to her, and gets to rescue her again.</description>

      <description>Memories of Peter (1) Peter’s brother, Hugh, shared the following memories of Peter’s childhood at the memorial on 6 Jan 2016:
My earliest memories of Peter are when he was four years old, in our tropical bungalow in Livingstone (now Zambia)—within sight of the plume of spray from the Victoria Falls. We each had an African minder and a pet: Richard a sulky eagle owl chained to a stump; Pete a mongoose which nipped our heels but was meant to deter snakes (Dickie, our Dad, named it Ricki-Ticki-Tavi after Kipling); I had an armadillo which was singularly unresponsive to affectionate stroking.</description>

      <description>Memories of Peter (2) Peter’s eldest daughter, Philippa, shared the following memories of Peter’s early career at the memorial on 6 Jan 2016:
So there was Peter at King’s College, Cambridge. Dad, typically, said that he felt he wasted his time there, worked ineffectually and took little part in the many extra-curricular activities on offer. He didn’t get the hoped-for first in his finals, but even so, the college gave him a bursary to study for a PhD.</description>

Now, for this next piece I need you to imagine that I’m voicing over the sound of a typewriter. It’s coming from up a stairway or behind a study door, and it sounds like this:
Chack-chack-chack-chak. (Pause for thought.) Chackchackchackchackchackchack… Peter typing

      <title>On Writing Novels</title>
      <link>http://peterdickinson.com/writing/writing-novels/</link>

      <description>On Writing Novels I have always taken writing for children and writing for adults equally seriously, but my relationship with the adult novels is different, more willed, less “given”. There are of course repetitive themes. My children say that my definitive novel will be about a chimpanzee trying to support a great country house by writing best-sellers.
I was brought up as one of the impoverished gentry, but despite a patrician accent and manner have never felt confident that I belonged in my supposed class; and I spent formative parts of my adolescence in a big Georgian house where my two old cousins were struggling on inadequate funds to keep things going in order to be able to hand it on to the heir to whom it was entailed.</description>
