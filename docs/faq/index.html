<h1 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<p>test</p>

<h2 id="note">Note</h2>

<pre><code>If you’re upon a School Assignment
    You won’t be wanting this refinement.
Cheer up! There’s stuff about each book
    Elsewhere, if you would care to look.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="do-you-put-people-you-know-into-your-books">Do you put people you know into your books?</h2>

<pre><code>Where was she from, the woman in the tower?
    I pushed a doorway on the winding stair,
Stole hesitantly in, and she was there,
    An absolute presence, filling the room with power,
Her life a moment in my sleeping brain —
    I know her, though we never meet again.

By contrast, those I see from day to day
    I know by fits and snatches at the most,
A fluid jigsaw, many pieces lost.
    What their real self is, who am I to say?
Though she’s the one with whom I share my life,
    Can I be truly said to know my wife?
</code></pre>

<h2 id="have-you-any-advice-for-a-young-writer">Have you any advice for a young writer?</h2>

<pre><code>Perfection? There is no such stuff.
But good enough is not enough.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="what-is-your-favourite-book">What is your favourite book?</h2>

<pre><code>What is your favourite kind of food? say I.
If you have one — just one — you’re worth a sigh.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="how-did-you-become-a-writer">How did you become a writer?</h2>

<pre><code>It isn’t something I became —
    It is the only life I know.
    If you could somehow dam the flow
I’d be a writer just the same.

The condor in your local zoo,
    Caged, wing-clipped, fed — what is it for?
    It is a creature made to soar,
A dot on the enormous blue.
</code></pre>

<h2 id="where-do-you-get-your-ideas">Where Do You Get Your Ideas?</h2>

<pre><code>A money spider hanging in mid air.
    Like a retinal fleck it dangles from the lamp
In the blank bathroom, neither here nor there.
    You reach to take the thread. Your fingers clamp

On nothing — nothing to feel or see — and yet
    The thread is there, because the spider heaves
Beneath your hand. You take and loose it at
    The sill, to live what life a spider lives.

A symbol surely, or a metaphor
    At least. The groping mind grasps nothing. Still,
Some line of thought must have existed, for
    This fleck now dangles here, this page its sill.
